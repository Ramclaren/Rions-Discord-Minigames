# Rions-Discord-Minigames

Overview:
This is a discord bot that has three mini-games built in, along with other small bits of funtionality. Upon installation the /bot-info command details the other commands. This is designed to be a small pass time for fellow discord users.

Features:
The main features are the Dice roller, Rock Paper Scissors, and Tic Tac Toe mini games. There is are also commands that return text and one that returns your profile picture.

Tech Stack:
The bot is coded completely with javascript, using node.js and discord.js to run the bot locally. I chose to use JavaScript over Python because the python functionality is outdated.

Installation:
 	
  1. Download Node.js and Discord.js or see https://discordjs.guide for extra help with installation
  
  2. Create a discord bot on the developer portal https://discord.com/developers/applications (Make sure to give admin permissions)
  
  3. Update the config file with your respective Bot Token, Client Id, and Guild ID (Only Bot Token Required)
  
  4. Run the deploy commads file and then index in Command Prompt, Powershell, or IDE of choice
  
  5. The commands should appear in your bot's command list!
  
  6. Use /bot-info for a short description of the main functions
  
  
For Developers there is alot of trial and error involved. I recommend using a personal server for testing.
  
  
Potential Issues:
  DON'T DOWNLOAD Discord.py, code is outdated and will not work.
